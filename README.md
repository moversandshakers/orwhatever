orwhatever
==========

The OR-Whatever iPhone app developed at iOSDevCamp2013. I came up with the idea on Friday afternoon, and it was complete by noon on Sunday. I (Jon Richards) did all the coding, and I taught my kids how to use Gimp for the artwork.

This app won the "Best Social Media App" at iOSDevCamp2013. Did it in 20 hours!

NOTE: This app does not work well in the simulator. It has to be running on an iPhone in order for it to access the native facebook.
